    <p>Description (Tentative):
    </p>
    <p>A pill-taking reminder consists of multiple stickers and a box. Family members can help the patients set up the alarm by recording their voices and sticking the sticker to the bottom of the pill bottle. They also need to set up the alarm time per
        day.


    </p>
    <p>
        During the time the user needs to take pills, the alarm will sound indicating which sticker/pills they need to take with the pre-recorded sounds from their family members/physicians. The user then can take the bottle next to the reminder, if itâ€™s the
        correct one, the reminder will state that it's correct and the amount the user should take each time; if it's not, the reminder will ask the user to try another bottle.

    </p>
