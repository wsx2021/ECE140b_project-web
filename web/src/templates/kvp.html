        <h2>Key Value Propositions</h2>

    </div>
    <br>
    <p>What is KVP:
    </p>
    <p>A value proposition should clearly explain how a product fills a need, communicate the specifics of its added benefit, and state the reason why it's better than similar products on the market. The ideal value proposition is to-the-point and appeals
        to a customer's strongest decision-making drivers.

            <p>Our PillCare</p>
            <p>helps family members</p>
            <p>who have elders in the family and want to take care their medication</p>
            <p>by saying no to the cold machine voice alarm </p>
            <p>and saying yes to the low-cost alarms recorded by their beloved family members</p>
            <p>unlike CVS’s App, Scrip Talk, and Hero</p>

        <img src="/image/competitor.jpg">
        <ol>
            <li>Compared to CVS’s App that needs to use App’s scan functionality, which might be troubling for elders who are not good at using phones, Pill Care allows the elders to simply put the pill bottle on the Pill Care to get information. </li>
            <li>Compared to Scrip Talk that is set by physicians, Pill Care allows family members to set up, customizing voices and records that elders are more comfortable with. Also, not all pharmacies support Scrip Talk.
            </li>
            <li>Compared to Hero, which does a good job of simplifying product usage process and auto pill dispensing, its one problem is its high price of the machine (100$) and monthly subscription fee (25$). Pill Care offers no subscription fee and now
                estimates a price lower than 50$.</li>
        </ol>
