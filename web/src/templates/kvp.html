    <p>A pill-taking reminder consists of multiple stickers and a box. Family members can help the patients set up the alarm by recording their voices and sticking the sticker to the bottom of the pill bottle. They also need to set up the alarm time per
        day.

    <ol class="extra-small">
        <li>Compared to CVS’s App that needs to use App’s scan functionality, which might be troubling for elders who are not good at using phones, Pill Care allows the elders to simply put the pill bottle on the Pill Care to get information. </li>
        <li>Compared to Scrip Talk that is set by physicians, Pill Care allows family members to set up, customizing voices and records that elders are more comfortable with. Also, not all pharmacies support Scrip Talk.
        </li>
        <li>Compared to Hero, which does a good job of simplifying product usage process and auto pill dispensing, its one problem is its high price of the machine (100$) and monthly subscription fee (25$). Pill Care offers no subscription fee and now estimates
            a price lower than 50$.</li>
