    <p>Description (Tentative):
    </p>
    <p>A pill-taking reminder consists of multiple stickers and a box. Family members can help the patients set up the alarm by recording their voices and sticking the sticker to the bottom of the pill bottle. They also need to set up the alarm time per
        day.
